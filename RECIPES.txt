#bulk loading recipes

Recipies are bulk loaded in the same way inventory is loaded. A comma delimited
list of first the recipe name followed by the first component of an ingredient
then followed by the second component (the amount) of that ingredient. This
can be done for as many ingredients as you would like. The format looks like
this:
	Recipe Name, Igredient One Name, Ingredient One Amount

Each line is itereatd through and a list of tuples is made from the Ingredient
components.
