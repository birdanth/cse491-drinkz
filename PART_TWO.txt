For my implementation in the previous homework, I gave a rather gradiose implmentation of 
everything, but decided to simply implement the portion which works with recipe to wine
pairings. I did this by making a table named 'pairings' in which you can add a recipe name
and its paired wines. Then to print out all the pairings you simply execute 'db.all_pairings().'
I didnt have enough time to implement adding,deleting, or manipulating pairings, but I would
do it via cursor.execute SQL commands. I like the idea of storing the pairings in a table,
ideally in a seperate file that periodically updates itself with good recipe to wine/drink
pairings. This when someone adds a drinks to what they are bringing they could simply cross
check the pairings table for any good pairings - which could be done by simply entering
their drink name or recipe name in a field on the website somewhere.
